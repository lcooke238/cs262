# COMPSCI 262: Distributed Systems
This repository constains our coursework for the Spring 2023 iteration of Distributed Systems at Harvard. Our work is organized as follows:
- ```proj```: folder containing the code and documentation for our final project, a distributed file system where users can upload and access files from multiple machines at any time.
- ```pset1```: folder containing the code and documentation for the first assignment, building our own chat application both using gRPC and using our own wire protocol.
- ```pset2```: folder containing the code and documentation for the second assignment, experimenting with logical clocks and logs to understand time in a distributed system.
- ```pset3```: folder containing the code and documentation for the third assignment, redesigning our initial chat application to be both persistent and 2-fault tolerant.
