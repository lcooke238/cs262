# COMPSCI 262 Pset 2: Lab Notebook

## Prompt
Examine logs and discuss the size of jumps in the vals for the logical clocks, drift in the vals of the local logical clocks in the different machines (compared to system time), and the impact different timings on such things as gaps in the logical clock vals and length of the msg queue. Include observations and reflections abt the model and the results of running the model

## Experiment 1: Default
For our first experiment, we ran our mock system with three connected machines for a minute. Our clock randomization was in the default 1-6 range and our machine action randomization was also in the default 1-10 range. Here is what we found:

1. *Jump Size* In general, we see that the logical clock vals increase gradually over time, with occasional jumps when a message is sent or received, meaning our definition for when a logical clock is updating is working to spec. 
2. *Value Drift and Explanation* When we compare our logical clock time to the system time in both directions. We had instances where the logical clock value runs slightly slower and slightly faster than the system time would indicate, meaning that there is no parseable pattern between the difference betwen system and logical clock time. As a result, there is no reliable notion of actual time between machines that we can have. As for what causes this drift, We can see that when there are delays in message delivery that can result in larger gaps in the logical clock values. For example, in one experiment in machine 0, we had a gap of 6 logical clock units between the message sent to machine 1 and the message received from machine 2. This is likely due to the fact that there was a delay in the delivery of the message from machine 2 to machine 0. Similarly, in machine 1, there is a gap of 3 logical clock units between the message received from machine 0 and the message sent to machine 2. This is likely due to the fact that there was a delay in the delivery of the message from machine 0 to machine 1. 
3. *Impact of message queue length* We also see the probability of delays increase with longer message queues.  For example, in machine 0, there are two messages in the queue after the message is sent to machine 1. This is likely due to the fact that machine 0 is waiting for a message from machine 1 and machine 2, but there is a delay in the delivery of these messages. Similarly, in machine 1, there are two messages in the queue after the message is sent to machine 2. This is likely due to the fact that machine 1 is waiting for a message from machine 0, but there is a delay in the delivery of this message.

## Takeaways
Overall, the logical clock model has been quite useful tool for tracking the order of events in a distributed system, allowing us to order events properly without knowing the exact time that they occured on the system. We saw that the size of jumps in the logical clock values can vary depending on the frequency and timing of events, and that the length of the message queue can also vary depending on the frequency and timing of events. We also thought a bit about the limitations of this simulation in understanding network behavior, ignoring things like network latency, message loss, and machine failures that could all impact the ordering of events.
