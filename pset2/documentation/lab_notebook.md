# COMPSCI 262 Pset 2: Lab Notebook

## Experiment 1
For our first experiment, we ran our mock system with three connected machines for a minute. Our clock randomization was in the default 1-6 range and our machine action randomization was also in the default 1-10 range.

**Prompt for Analysis**: examine logs and discuss the size of jumps in the vals for the logical clocks, drift in the vals of the local logical clocks in the different machines (compared to system time), and the impact different timings on such things as gaps in the logical clock vals and length of the msg queue. Include observations and reflections abt the model and the results of running the model
